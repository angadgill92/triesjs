### Tries

Tries are `re*trie*val` trees.

### Usage

``````shell
$ git clone https://github.com/angadgill92/triesjs
$ cd triesjs
$ node index.js path/to/wordlist/file 
# the program currently expects a line separated text file
# you can change the delimiter in the index.js file from '\n' to whatever 
# ... your input file has (e.g ',' (comma))
``````
